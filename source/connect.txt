Overview
--------

This page contains code examples that show how to connect your PHP application
to MongoDB with various settings.

.. tip::

  To learn more about the connection options on this page, see the link
  provided in each section.

To use a connection example from this page, copy the code example into the
:ref:`sample application <php-connect-sample>` or your own application.
Make sure to set the ``MONGODB_URI`` environment variable to the
connection string for your MongoDB deployment and replace all placeholders
in the code examples, such as ``<hostname>``, with the relevant values for your
MongoDB deployment.
