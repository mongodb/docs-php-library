Overview
--------

To connect to a MongoDB deployment, you must create the following items:

- **Connection URI**, also known as a *connection string*, which tells the {+library-short+}
  which MongoDB deployment to connect to.
- **MongoDB\\Client** object, which creates the connection to the MongoDB deployment
  and lets you perform operations on it.

You can also set options within either or both of these components to
customize the way that the {+library-short+} behaves
while connected to MongoDB.

This guide describes the components of a connection string and shows how to
use a ``MongoDB\Client`` object to connect to a MongoDB deployment.

.. _php-connection-uri:

Connection URI
--------------

A standard connection string includes the following components:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Component
     - Description

   * - ``mongodb://``

     - Required. A prefix that identifies this as a string in the
       standard connection format.

   * - ``db_username:db_password``

     - Optional. Authentication credentials. If you include these, the client
       authenticates the user against the database specified in ``authSource``.
       For more information about the ``authSource`` connection option, see
       :ref:`php-auth`. 

   * - ``host[:port]``

     - Required. The host and optional port number where MongoDB is running. If you don't
       include the port number, the driver uses the default port, ``27017``.

   * - ``/defaultauthdb``
     
     - Optional. The authentication database to use if the
       connection string includes ``db_username:db_password@``
       authentication credentials but not the ``authSource`` option. If you don't include 
       this component, the client authenticates the user against the ``admin`` database.

   * - ``?<options>``

     - Optional. A query string that specifies connection-specific
       options as ``<name>=<value>`` pairs. See
       :ref:`php-connection-options` for a full description of
       these options.

To learn more about connection strings, see
:manual:`Connection Strings </reference/connection-string>` in the
Server manual.

Create a MongoDB\\Client
------------------------

To create a connection to MongoDB, construct a ``MongoDB\Client`` object.
Pass the following parameters to the ``MongoDB\Client`` constructor:

- ``$uri``: Sets the connection URI.

- ``$uriOptions``: *(Optional)* Sets URI options to configure how the client
  connects to MongoDB, including authentication credentials and
  server selection settings. If you set the same options in this
  parameter and in your connection string, the ``$uriOptions`` values
  take precedence. To view a full list of supported options, see
  the :ref:`php-connection-options` guide.

- ``$driverOptions``: *(Optional)* Sets options to configure the behavior of the
  underlying {+extension-short+}, including data encryption settings and certificate
  validation options for TLS connections. To view a full list of supported options,
  see :phpmethod:`MongoDB\Client::__construct()` in the API documentation.

Example
~~~~~~~

This example constructs a client and passes the following parameters:

- Connection URI, which connects to a MongoDB deployment on port ``27017``
  of ``localhost``

- URI options parameter, which instructs the {+library-short+} to wait 
  ``10000`` milliseconds for server selection before generating an error
