   .. step:: Install dependencies

      Before you begin developing, ensure that you have the following
      dependencies installed on your local machine:
      
      - `PHP <https://www.php.net/manual/en/install.php>`__ version 7.4 or later
      - `Composer <https://getcomposer.org/download/>`__ version 2.0 or later
    
   .. step:: Install the MongoDB PHP extension

      Run the following command to install the ``mongodb`` PHP extension:
      
      .. code-block:: bash

         sudo pecl install mongodb

   .. step:: Update your PHP configuration file

      To enable the ``mongodb`` extension in your PHP configuration file, add the
      following line to the top of your ``php.ini`` file:

      .. code-block:: none

         extension=mongodb.so

      .. tip::

         You can locate your ``php.ini`` file by running the following command
         in your shell:

         .. code-block:: bash

            php --ini

   .. step:: Create a project directory

      From your root directory, run the following command in your shell to create
      a directory called ``php-quickstart`` for this project:

      .. code-block:: bash

         mkdir php-quickstart

      Select the tab corresponding to your operating system and run the following commands
      to create a ``quickstart.php`` application file in the ``php-quickstart`` directory:

      .. tabs::

          .. tab:: macOS / Linux
             :tabid: create-file-mac-linux

             .. code-block:: bash

                cd php-quickstart
                touch quickstart.php

          .. tab:: Windows
             :tabid: create-file-windows

             .. code-block:: bash

                cd php-quickstart
                type nul > quickstart.php

   .. step:: Install the {+php-library+}

      To install the {+php-library+}, run the following command in your ``php-quickstart``
      directory:

      .. code-block:: bash

         composer require mongodb/mongodb
      
      After installing the library, include Composer's ``autoload.php`` file by adding the
      following code to the top of your ``quickstart.php`` file:

      .. code-block:: php

         <?php

         require_once __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

After you complete these steps, you have a new project directory, a
new application file, and the library dependencies installed.
