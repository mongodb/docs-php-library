Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use the {+driver-short+} to perform
**transactions**. Transactions allow you to perform a series of operations
that change data only if the entire transaction is committed.
If any operation in the transaction does not succeed, the driver stops the
transaction and discards all data changes before they ever become
visible. This feature is called **atomicity**.

In MongoDB, transactions run within logical sessions. A
session is a grouping of related read or write operations that you
want to run sequentially. Sessions enable causal consistency for a group
of operations and allow you to run operations in an **ACID-compliant**
transaction, which is a transaction that meets an expectation of
atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability. MongoDB guarantees
that the data involved in your transaction operations remains
consistent, even if the operations encounter unexpected errors.

When using the {+php-library+}, you can create a new session from a
``MongoDB\Client`` instance. Then, you can use the resulting
``MongoDB\Driver\Session`` instance to perform transactions. You can
improve your app's performance by reusing your client for multiple
sessions and transactions instead of instantiating a new client each
time.

.. warning::

   Use a ``Session`` only in operations running on the
   ``Client`` that created it. Using a ``Session`` with a
   different ``Client`` results in operation errors.

Methods
-------

Create a ``Session`` by using the ``MongoDB\Client::startSession()``
method on your ``Client`` instance. The {+php-library+} provides a
Convenient Transaction API to manage the transaction lifecyle. Use the
``MongoDB\with_transaction()`` method to run custom callback within a
transaction. The ``with_transaction()`` method starts the transaction,
then either commits it or ends it if there are errors. The
:ref:`php-txn-example` section of this guide demonstrates how to use
this API to perform a transaction. 

Alternatively, you can have more control over your transaction lifecyle
by using the methods provided by the ``Session`` class. The
following table describes these methods:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 25 75
   :stub-columns: 1
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Method
     - Description

   * - ``startTransaction()``
     - | Starts a new transaction on this session. The session
         must be passed into each operation within the transaction, or
         the operation will run outside of the transaction.
       |
       | You can set transaction options by passing an options parameter.

   * - ``commitTransaction()``
     - | Commits the active transaction for this session. This method returns an
         error if there is no active transaction for the session or the
         transaction was previously ended.

   * - ``abortTransaction()``
     - | Ends the active transaction for this session. This method returns an
         error if there is no active transaction for the session or if the
         transaction was committed or ended.

.. _php-txn-example:

Transaction Example
-------------------

The following code defines the ``transferTxn()`` callback function that
modifies data in the ``saving_accounts``, ``checking_accounts``, and ``receipts``
collections of the ``bank`` database:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/write/transaction.php
   :language: php
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin-callback
   :end-before: end-callback

Then, run the following code to perform the transaction. This code
completes the following actions:

1. Creates a session from the client by using the ``startSession()`` method.
#. Calls the ``with_transaction()`` method to manage the transaction,
   passing the session and the callback as parameters.

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /includes/write/transaction.php
      :language: php
      :dedent:
      :start-after: begin-txn
      :end-before: end-txn

   .. output:: 
      :language: console
      :visible: false

      Successfully performed transaction!
